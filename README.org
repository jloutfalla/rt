This is a simple implementation in C of the ray tracer presented in
[[https://raytracing.github.io][Peter Shirley's books]] with some enhancements like multi-threaded
rendering.

** Build
First of all, you will need =make= and the =pthread= library to build
=rt=. If you don't have it or you don't want multi-threaded rendering,
you can go comment everything related to this in [[./src/rt.c][rt.c]]
and change the =run= rule in the [[./Makefile][Makefile]] to use the
commented command instead.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  make # Just to create rt executable
  make run # Create rt executable and run it
#+END_SRC
